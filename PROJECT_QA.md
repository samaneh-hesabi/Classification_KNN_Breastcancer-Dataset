# 1. Project Overview

## 1.1 Why was the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset chosen for this project?
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset was chosen for several reasons:
- It's a well-known, clean, and well-documented dataset in the machine learning community
- It represents a real-world medical classification problem
- The dataset has a good balance of features (30) and samples (569)
- It's suitable for binary classification, making it ideal for demonstrating KNN's capabilities
- The features are all numerical, which works well with KNN's distance-based approach

## 1.2 Why was KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) chosen as the classification model?
KNN was selected because:
- It's a simple, intuitive algorithm that's easy to understand and implement
- It's a non-parametric method, meaning it makes no assumptions about the underlying data distribution
- It works well with the numerical features in the breast cancer dataset
- It's particularly effective when the decision boundary is irregular
- It provides both classification and probability estimates, which are valuable in medical diagnosis

## 1.3 What preprocessing steps were taken and why?
The following preprocessing steps were implemented:
- **Train-Test Split**: The data was split 80-20 to evaluate model performance on unseen data
- **Feature Scaling**: StandardScaler was used to normalize the features because:
  - KNN is distance-based, so features need to be on the same scale
  - Different features in the breast cancer dataset have different units and ranges
  - Scaling prevents features with larger ranges from dominating the distance calculations

## 1.4 How was the model evaluated?
The model was evaluated using multiple metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of predictions
- **Precision**: Ability to correctly identify positive cases
- **Recall**: Ability to find all positive cases
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **Confusion Matrix**: Detailed breakdown of true/false positives/negatives

## 1.5 Why was a toy dataset created and tested?
The toy dataset serves several purposes:
- Demonstrates how the model works on new, unseen data
- Shows the model's ability to make predictions on individual samples
- Provides insight into the model's confidence in its predictions
- Helps understand how the model generalizes to new data points
- Illustrates the practical application of the trained model

## 1.6 What are the limitations of this implementation?
Some limitations include:
- Fixed k-value (k=5) was used without optimization
- No feature selection or dimensionality reduction was performed
- The toy dataset is randomly generated and may not represent real-world scenarios
- No hyperparameter tuning was performed
- No cross-validation was implemented for the main model

## 1.7 How could this project be improved?
Potential improvements include:
- Implementing k-fold cross-validation to find the optimal k value
- Adding feature selection to reduce dimensionality
- Implementing grid search for hyperparameter tuning
- Adding visualization of the decision boundaries
- Including more sophisticated evaluation metrics
- Adding data visualization to better understand the dataset
